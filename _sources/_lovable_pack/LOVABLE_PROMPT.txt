TITEL (ENGLISH):
EAI HUB. SSOT. DIDACTICS FIRST.

CONTEXT
I uploaded a zip “eai-studio-10.0.zip”. Keep ALL content. Do NOT delete files. If you need a clean app structure, create a NEW folder (e.g., /lovable-app) and copy the required frontend source there, but preserve the original files for reference.

GOAL
Build a polished, responsive website + prototype UI in Lovable (dark/teal, minimal, dashboard-first), using Dutch copy (except the title).
Pages:
1) Landing
2) Student Studio
3) Docent Cockpit
4) Admin/Docs placeholder (optional)

IMPORTANT
- Prefer the frontend code under /apps/web/src if present.
- Keep mock data and prepare a Supabase-ready data layer.
- Never put LLM API keys in the browser.

DELIVERABLE
A Lovable project that runs cleanly, plus an unchanged /sources snapshot of the original repository content.
